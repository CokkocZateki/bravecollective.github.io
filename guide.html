			<h2 class="mainBullet">Apply to Brave Newbies Inc.</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Method 1, In game browser - Right click the <url=showinfo:2//98169165>Brave Newbies Inc.</url> link.  On the bottom right is a button to apply to corp.</li>
				<li>Method 2, E > Social > Corp <a href="images/OBVIOUSLYtheEasiestWayToApplyToBrave.png">[screenshot]</a> (Note the "E" in this screenshot.  It will be referred to often.</li>
			</ol>
			
			Applying first thing gives us some time for your corp status to update before we try to join authenticated corp communications later.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Finish your tutorial missions!</h2>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Start training skills!</h2>
			<ul>				
				<li>Your tutorial missions will probably have you start training something. Good all-around <i>basic</i> skills that everyone should have include Navigation III, CPU Management III, Afterburner III, and Power Grid Management III. </li>
				<li><a href="basicskills.html">A brief guide to other skills you want to train can be found here.</a></li>				
				<li>See Also: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/comments/1w6yzz/brave_dojo_nancy_crows_40_day_newbie_skillplan/">The 40-day skill plan</a></li>
				<li>Place holder: More in-depth stuff here, such as corporate approved doctrine fittings, will come later in the guide.</li>
				<li>Brave also runs a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1jFDEVS.jpg">free skillbook program.</a>  Though they do ask that you don't request more than a few days of books at a time.  <a href="https://forums.bravecollective.net/dg/531bbb7358b70003566717bc">List of skillbooks and more info on secure site.</a></li>			
			</ul>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Unfuck your overview! </h2>
				Download <a href="overviewsetup.html">Sarah's Overview Pack</a> and follow the instructions found on the page. It is important that you not only install the pack but also follow the instructions to make sure all people have the correct color in your overview </br>
				This ensures that you don't shoot friendlies, and you can reasonably tell when it's safe to shoot enemies.  <b>It's important.</b></br>
				Note that on the main PvP tab, you won't be able to see friendlies.  In your frigate roams with 20 of your best friends, you don't really want them hiding important information.  Besides, they're still on tab 4 if you want to see that they're near.</br>
				There's a few caveats such as learning how to see drones, loot cans, and planets. You can ask about that in the dojo.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Come out to Sendaya!</h2>
				You could die on the way.  If you're in a frigate, shuttle, or pod, you'll <i>probably</i> be fine.  The best way to experience eve is to dive in head first.  You don't have that much to lose at this point anyway.  Just make sure you have a clone (and if you did the tutorial missions, it would have walked you through this).</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Join Mumble and the secure alliance forums. </h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://mumble.sourceforge.net/">Install Files</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://github.com/bravecollective/mumble/wiki">How To</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/lc32plo">How To in video form</a></li>
				</ul>
				You'll need it for your first frigate roam, which should be very soon.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Join Jabber (optional but recommended) <a href="http://imgur.com/jklj5yD">How To</a></h2>
				This is a generic IM client which will send you notifications when fleets are forming up and big things are happening.</br>
				It's also worth turning off join and leave channel messages. <a href="https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin#hide-joins-parts">How To</a></br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Turn off CSPA charges - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DSxBlsk.gif">How To</a></h2>
				This is an anti-spam measure that will annoy your friends or anyone trying to help/talk to you.  It's a fee to start a conversation with you, and it's really unnecessary.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Newbie's First Fleet</h2>
				Feel free to do whatever you like at this point.  If you're looking for something to do, <a href="newbiesfirstfleet.html">read this and join your first fleet!</a> You don't even need to bring a ship.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">How to ask questsions</h2>
				First, check the <a href="bravefaq.html">Brave FAQ</a></br>
				Second, spend at least 90 seconds googling.</br>
				Third, ask in the Brave Dojo channel. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/K7zFS2o.gif">How to join a chat channel</a></br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Don't worry about hauling your stuff</h2>
				Frankly, your stuff weighs more than it's worth paying someone to carry it.  Leave it all behind besides the ship you're flying in and some ammo. If you find you really need it later, you can always go back for it.</br>
				If you really know what you're doing, and you're certain you want stuff hauled: <a href="haulinginfo.html">More Info</a></br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Do not, I repeat, do not use corp mail.</h2>
				We have several thousand people in the corp, if everyone spammed corp mail for every little thing it would turn into a mess very quickly.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Check Alliance Bulletins <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0EDjpEH.png">How To</a></h2>
				There may be more updated information there than what is in this guide.</br>
