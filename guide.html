		<div class="mainBullet">Apply to <url=showinfo:2//98169165>Brave Newbies Inc.</url></div>
			<div class="subBulletA">Method 1, In game browser - Right click the <url=showinfo:2//98169165>Brave Newbies Inc.</url> link.  On the bottom right is a button to apply to corp.</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">Method 2, E > Social > Corp <a href="images/OBVIOUSLYtheEasiestWayToApplyToBrave.png">[screenshot]</a> (Note the "E" in this screenshot.  It will be referred to often.</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">Applying first thing gives us some time for your corp status to update before we try to join authenticated corp communications later.</div>
		<div class="mainBullet">Finish your tutorial missions!</div>
		<div class="mainBullet">Start training skills!</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">Your tutorial missions will probably have you start training something.  Good all-around basics skills that everyone should have include Navigation III, CPU Management III, Afterburner III, and Power Grid Management III. <a href="basicskills.html">Here's a brief guide to the initial skills you should train.</a></div>
			<div class="subBulletA">More in-depth stuff here, such as corporate approved doctrine fittings, will come later in the guide.</div>

		<div class="mainBullet">Unfuck your overview! <a href="overviewsetup.html">Sarah's Overview Pack and Instructions</a>.</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">This ensures that you don't shoot friendlies, and you can reasonably tell when it's safe to shoot enemies.  <b>It's important.</b></div>
			<div class="subBulletA">Note that on the main PvP tab, you won't be able to see friendlies.  In your frigate roams with 20 of your best friends, you don't really want them hiding important information.  Besides, they're still on tab 4 if you want to see that they're near.</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">There's a few caveats such as learning how to see drones, loot cans, and planets, which someone should probably talk about, but that can wait.</div>
		<div class="mainBullet">Come out to Sendaya!</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">You could die on the way.  If you're in a frigate, shuttle, or pod, you'll <i>probably</i> be fine.  The best way to experience eve is to dive in head first.  You don't have that much to lose at this point anyway.  Just make sure you have a clone (and if you did the tutorial missions, it would have walked you through this).</div>

			<div class="subBulletA">You'll need it for your first frigate roam, which should be very soon.</div>
		<div class="mainBullet">Join Jabber (optional). <a href="http://imgur.com/jklj5yD">How To</a></div>
			<div class="subBulletA">This is a generic IM client which will send you notifications when fleets are forming up and big things are happening.</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">It's also worth turning off join and leave channel messages. <a href="https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin#hide-joins-parts">How To</a></div>
		<div class="mainBullet">Turn off CSPA charges - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DSxBlsk.gif">How To</a></div>
			<div class="subBulletA">This is an anti-spam measure that will annoy your friends or anyone trying to help/talk to you.  It's a fee to start a conversation with you, and it's really unnecessary.</div>
		<div class="mainBullet">Newbie's First Fleet</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">Feel free to do whatever you like at this point.  If you're looking for something to do, <a href="newbiesfirstfleet.html">read this and join your first fleet!</a> You don't even need to bring a ship.</div>
		<div class="mainBullet">How to ask questsions</url></div>
			<div class="subBulletA">First, check the <a href="bravefaq.html">Brave FAQ</a></div>
			<div class="subBulletA">Second, spend at least 90 seconds googling.</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">Third, ask in the Brave Dojo channel. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/K7zFS2o.gif">How to join a chat channel</a></div>
		<div class="mainBullet">Don't worry about hauling your stuff</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">Frankly, your stuff weighs more than it's worth paying someone to carry it.  Leave it all behind besides the ship you're flying in and some ammo. If you find you really need it later, you can always go back for it.</div>
		<div class="mainBullet">Do not, I repeat, do not use corp mail.</div>
			<div class="subBulletA">We have several thousand people in the corp, if everyone spammed corp mail for every little thing it would turn into a mess very quickly.</div>
		<div class="mainBullet">Check Alliance Bulletins <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0EDjpEH.png">How To</a></div>
			<div class="subBulletA">There may be more updated information there than what is in this guide.</div>
